# Sample project

## Introduction
The project in this repository represents a simple project, in which I have tried to implement as much as possible technologies, that a microservice project would need.

- Microservices project
- Domain-Drive Development (DDD)
- EntiryFrameworkCore
- Azure Storage Model
- Datbase per Service Architecture : as the project is developed DDD, each service can have a database for itself. It's important that based on the service requiremenst the database can be changed flexible.


## Create new project via commandline
dotnet new webapi --name Sample.Api.Persistenc
